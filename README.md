# Final Assignment of SQL course

# Assignment Topic:
   In this assignment, you will download the datasets provided, load them into a database, write and execute SQL queries to answer the problems provided, and upload a screenshot showing the correct SQL query and result for review by your peers. A Jupyter notebook is provided in the preceding lesson to help you with the process.


   This assignment involves 3 datasets for the city of Chicago obtained from the Chicago Data Portal:
